# Fortune 500 Debt Risk Classification
## Overview

This project develops a supervised machine learning model to classify Fortune 500 companies into debt-risk bands using financial fundamentals.

The objective was to determine whether leverage risk can be predicted from indirect financial indicators, while intentionally excluding direct leverage components from model features to avoid leakage.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow including data preparation, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
